# BuildDataverseSolution: Streamlined PCF Control Deployment

*A comprehensive CI/CD solution for Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) controls*

## The Story Behind the Tool

Once again, I got bored on a weekend. You know that feeling, right? Sitting there on a Saturday morning with a cup of coffee, thinking to myself: "How can I make my life easier?" 

As an internal developer who juggles multiple projects across different languages on a daily basis, I constantly find myself forgetting the little details. Sometimes I can't even find the resources buried somewhere in my brain. One minute I'm working on a React component, the next I'm debugging PowerShell scripts for Dataverse automation, then I'm back to TypeScript for a PCF control, followed by some C# plugins for Dynamics 365, and don't even get me started on Business Central extensions. Sound familiar?

So there I was, starting yet another PCF project, and I realized I was going through the same tedious process I'd done dozens of times before:
- "Wait, how do I set up the Power Platform CLI again?"
- "What was that exact command sequence to create and package the solution?"
- "Where did I put that build script from the last project?"

That's when it hit me - I needed to create a helpful tool for myself to speed up this process. Not just for this weekend project, but for every PCF control I'd build in the future. And knowing me, I'd probably forget how to use my own tool by Monday, so it better be simple!

What started as a weekend side project to solve my own problems turned into something I'm genuinely excited to share with the developer community.

## Overview

**BuildDataversePCFSolution** is the result of that weekend coding session (okay, maybe it took a few weekends). It's a powerful, YAML-driven build system that transforms the way developers build, package, and deploy PCF controls to the Power Platform. Born from my own frustration with repetitive build processes, this tool provides a complete CI/CD pipeline from source code to deployable Power Platform solutions.

## The Problem It Solves

Developing PCF controls traditionally involves multiple manual steps:
- Building the TypeScript/React component  
- Installing and managing NPM dependencies
- Configuring Power Platform CLI (PAC)
- Creating Power Platform solutions
- Adding PCF references to solutions
- Building and packaging solutions
- Managing different build configurations
- Handling CI/CD integration

Each project required custom scripts, and developers often copied and modified build processes across projects, leading to inconsistency and maintenance overhead.

## The BuildDataversePCFSolution Approach

This tool revolutionizes PCF development by providing:

### 🎯 **Single Configuration File**
Everything is defined in one `solution.yaml` file:
```yaml
solution:
  name: "MyPCFControl"
  version: "1.0.0"
  
publisher:
  name: "MyCompany"
  prefix: "myco"
  
build:
  solutionType: "Both"  # Managed, Unmanaged, or Both
```

### 🚀 **One-Line Installation**
Install directly from GitHub in any PCF project:
```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garethcheyne/BuildDataversePCFSolution/main/install.ps1 | iex

# macOS/Linux (Bash)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garethcheyne/BuildDataversePCFSolution/main/install.sh | bash
```

### ⚡ **Single Command Build**
After installation, build your entire solution with:
```bash
npm run boom
```

## Key Features

## Architecture

The BuildDataversePCFSolution system consists of several key components:

### Core Build Engine (`build-solution.ps1`)
The PowerShell-based build engine that:
- Parses YAML configuration
- Orchestrates the entire build pipeline
- Manages Power Platform CLI operations
- Handles different CI/CD environments
- Creates versioned solution packages

### Configuration System (`solution.yaml`)
A comprehensive YAML configuration that defines:
- Solution metadata (name, version, description)
- Publisher information (name, prefix, display name)
- Build settings (type, clean install, validation)
- Custom scripts (pre/post build hooks)
- Environment-specific overrides

### Installation System
Cross-platform installers that:
- Download and install BuildDataversePCFSolution files
- Check and install PCF development prerequisites (Node.js, .NET, PAC CLI)
- Validate PCF project structure
- Update package.json with boom script
- Create default solution.yaml configuration

### CI/CD Integration
Environment-aware features:
- GitHub Actions annotations and formatting
- Azure DevOps task integration and logging
- Local development with rich console output

## About the Author

Hi there! I'm Gareth, the developer behind BuildDataversePCFSolution. When I'm not busy juggling multiple projects across different tech stacks (seriously, some days I feel like I need a roadmap just to remember which IDE I'm supposed to be using), I enjoy creating tools that make my life - and hopefully yours - a bit easier.

This project started as a classic weekend "I wonder if I can automate this..." moment and evolved into something I use in every PCF project I work on. As an internal developer, I've learned that the best tools are the ones you actually want to use, not the ones you have to use.

I built BuildDataversePCFSolution because I was tired of:
- Forgetting the exact sequence of commands needed for PCF deployment
- Copy-pasting build scripts between projects (and inevitably breaking something)  
- Spending more time setting up builds than actually writing code
- Having different build processes for different projects (consistency, anyone?)

The tool you see today is the result of countless "Oh, I should add this feature too!" moments during my weekend coding sessions. Every feature exists because I needed it for a real project or got frustrated with some manual process.

If you're like me and prefer writing code to wrestling with build configurations, I think you'll find this tool as useful as I do. And if you find ways to make it even better, please let me know - I'm always looking for ways to make my future self's life easier!

Feel free to reach out if you have questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about PCF development. You can find me on GitHub or through the issues section of the BuildDataversePCFSolution repository.
